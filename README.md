# Frolics
A GUI interface to access and use various a Arduino board using Bluetooth module.


## Introduction
This project tries to connect and simplify your connection to Arduino communicating to the host via Bluetooth module. I used a ton of sensors to just check it. It can send command to the arduino boards(probably display on LED board) as well as read data from various sensors connected to it.

## About project
This project is a compilation of the few projects I made while stepping my foot in GUI programming 3~4 years back. Entire project is written in Processing JAVA and Arduino C++ files.
One can find more info about that language [here](https://www.processing.org) and [here](https://www.arduino.cc).

## How to Run
You will need a PDE and Arduino IDE to run this code and/or to compile it to distribute it. You can get PDE [here](https://www.processing.org/download) and arduino IDE [here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).

First you need to write the code on the arduino using Arduino IDE.Then connect the bluetooth module connected on the arduino to your PC. Then open .pde file using PDE and select COM port and then you are good to go.(Put ports according to the variable given in the .ino file)
If you face any problems, feel free to raise a issue.
